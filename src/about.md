# About

This book provides lots of [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) snippets that can help you to write better Typst code.

This is an unofficial book. Some snippets&suggestions here may be outdated or useless. However, _all of them should compile on last version of Typst[^1]_.

**CAUTION:** currently the book is a very early **WIP**, so don't rely on it.

## Contributions

Any contributions are very welcome! If you have a good code snippet that you want to share, feel free to submit an issue with snippet or make a PR in this [repository](https://github.com/sitandr/typst-examples-book).

I will especially appreciate submissions of active community members and compiler contributors. I'm ready to add them as collaborators since I want this book to be a truly community project.


[^1]: When a new version launches, it may take a few days to update the book, but not much more.
