# Typst Basics

Some examples are taken from [Official Tutorial](https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/) that is highly recommended for reading. However, the book there extends it a bit for a wider set of common tasks and knowledge.

> _Important:_ in most cases there will be used "clipped" examples of your rendered documents (no margins, smaller width and so on). 
> 
> To set up the spacing as you want, see corresponding example section [WIP]() and [Official Page Setting Guide](https://typst.app/docs/guides/page-setup-guide/).
