# Navigation

The book consists of several chapters, each with its own goal.

## 1. Tutorial

More specialized examples, less words than in [Official Tutorial](https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/). It is _highly recommended to read it anyway_.

## 2. Snippets

Useful snippets for common (and not) tasks.

## 3. Packages

Quick examples to make it easier choosing better suited library for your task.

## 4. Typstonomicon, or The Code You Should Not Write

Totally cursed examples, that you should use only in desperate situations.

I think that this chapter will slowly die as Typst matures.
