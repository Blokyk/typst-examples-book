Currently needed (any work encouraged):

- Editing (expanding examples, fixing bad language issues)
- Package overviews (see current empty themes)
- Selecting any really useful code examples from Discord and Github

If you think you can do some large work, please DM me in Discord (@sitandr) or mail (andr.sitnikov34@gmail.com) to avoid duplication.
